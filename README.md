Social media is internet-based communication. Users can hold conversations, share information, and produce web content. Blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, 
social networking sites, photo-sharing sites, instant messaging, video-sharing sites, podcasts, widgets, virtual worlds, and other types of social media exist. 
Developing a B-KUZU system would benefit Bhutanese of all ages who use social media. However, the system must provide a safe and secure platform. 
This system will fulfill the primary purpose for which it was designed, and it will also be available only to people who have Bhutanese phone numbers.

Problem Statement
Billions of people around the world use social media to share information and make connections. On a personal level, social media allows you to 
communicate with friends and family, learn new things, develop your interests, and be entertained. Nevertheless, its security and trustworthiness issues 
have also become increasingly serious, which need to be addressed urgently.

Facebook and Twitter, which are one of the biggest social media platforms, are all from other countries and there is no other option for Bhutanese citizens 
than to use those applications knowing that their data is going to be exploited. While they provide privacy options and say a lot of things about protecting 
our data, most of the time, our data would be used by these big companies without the consent of the users.(BBC News, 2018)  

There are also online users scamming Bhutanese people knowing that others will never find out their identity. (Bhutan’s Daily Newspaper, n.d.) Therefore,
for a country to not have its own social media platform is a big problem and gives these big companies an opportunity to exploit Bhutanese citizens. 

So, B-KUZU can be a solution to all these problems. B-KUZU will follow the ethics and laws of Bhutan and will guarantee that the data are not being misused. 
It could replace these foreign apps.. 


Features of the system are:

Post: Users can post any content on their page.

Likes: users can like each other's posts.

Comments: Users can comment on each other’s posts.

Chats: Users can message each other for more communication.

Add and remove friend  : Users can add friends and remove friends as well.

Edit Profile: Profile can be changed or edited.

Notification: Receives notification message.

System Architecture

Three-tier architecture is a well-established software application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers: 
the presentation tier, or user interface; the application tier, where data is processed; and the data tier, where the data associated with the application is 
stored and managed. 

Presentation Tier 
The presentation tier is the user interface and communication layer of the application, where the end user interacts with the application. Its main purpose 
is to display information to and collect information from the user. This top-level tier can function, for instance, on a desktop application, a web browser, 
or a graphical user interface (GUI). 


Application Tier 
The application tier, also known as the logic tier or middle tier, is the heart of the application. In this layer, data gathered in the presentation tier is
processed using business logic, or a particular set of business rules, sometimes in opposition to data gathered in the data tier. Data in the data tier may 
also be added, removed, or modified by the application tier.

Data Tier 
The data tier, sometimes called database tier, data access tier or back-end, is where the information processed by the application is stored and managed. 
This can be a relational database management system such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, Informix or Microsoft SQL Server, or in a NoSQL Database 
server such as Cassandra, CouchDB or MongoDB.
